# Pathfinder with multiple algorithms

## A Pathfinding program written in Python that allows the use of several pathfinding algorithms to find and draw a path between two points that the user has drawn on a grid.

The purpose of this program is to make the workings of several different pathfinding algorithms visualing appealing and easier to understand for visual learners. Currently the program includes the following algorithms:

- A* (A Star)
- Dijkstra

The user is able to draw obstacles for the algorithms to work around, in addition to being able to load up a preset maze with a single keystroke.
The distance of the final path between the start and end points is shown on-screen, as is the time taken for the algorithm to find the path. This is useful for comparing pathfinding algorithms and gaining an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm relative to one another.
Program controls can be projected on screen, making operation simple.
